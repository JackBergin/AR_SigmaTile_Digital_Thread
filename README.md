# AR_SigmaTile_Digital_Thread
In this project, I created an experience that connects to ThingWorx through a PostgreSQL DB known as an Experience Server and then from there displays live data in either a 2D GUI or a 3D AR experience. Users can also navigate to the IoT mashup but beware... it's password protected (jk its "changeme123456")
